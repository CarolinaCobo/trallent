# Trallent

Trallent is a site that organise candidates depending on the interview stage they are, so the users can see everything on a glance. The website is designed to be easy to navigate. 
 
A live version of the site is available [here](https://carolinacobo.github.io/CarolsKitchen/)

For this project it was required to create a user centric website using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript supported by other libraries as Bootstrap.
